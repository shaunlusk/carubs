Rough idea:
scan "hot" posts in a subreddit.
for each, all comments
for each comment, grab author
grab authors comments for past x days or so


Features to analyze:
posts per day
whether posts are spread through day or clustered - spread metric?
average post length
post length standard deviation
average post average upvotes
average post average downvotes
# subs posted to
sub similarity score?
whether the analyzed sub is the most commonly posted to
phrase repeat count
post similarity score (maybe use this one entirely instead of above)


Data to collect to generate Features
Post date
post time
post body length
post up
post down
